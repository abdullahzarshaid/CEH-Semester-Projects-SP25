# Ethical_Hacking_Scanning_Networks

## Overview
Module 3 focuses on network scanning and analysis, key components of penetration testing. Through hands-on activities, this module enhances your ability to discover, analyze, and assess network hosts and services, preparing you for deeper security evaluations.

## Learning Highlights
- **Network Configuration Mastery**: Using `ipconfig` and `ip a`, you gained proficiency in inspecting network setups across Windows and Linux environments, ensuring accurate identification of IP addresses and interfaces.
- **Host Discovery Precision**: Commands like `sudo nmap -sn -PE 192.168.56.102` taught you how to efficiently discover active hosts on a network, a foundational skill for mapping network topology.
- **Firewall and Connectivity Testing**: By pinging hosts (`ping 192.168.216.214`) and analyzing TTL values, you learned to verify network reachability and understand system responses across different operating systems.
- **Advanced Network Scanning**: Running `unicornscan 192.168.216.214 -Iv` provided insights into rapid TCP scanning, helping you identify open ports and services with speed and accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Target Analysis**: Using `nmap -A 192.168.216.214` and `nmap -O 192.168.216.214`, you explored aggressive scanning and OS detection, enabling you to gather detailed information about a target’s services, versions, and operating system.
- **Cross-Platform Network Tracing**: Executing `tracert` on Windows and `traceroute` on Parrot OS enhanced your ability to trace network paths, revealing potential points of failure or security weaknesses in the infrastructure.
- **Practical Network Monitoring**: Engaging with tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze ping traffic deepened your understanding of network protocols and packet-level interactions.

## Outcomes
This module has equipped you with the skills to thoroughly scan and analyze networks, identifying live hosts, open ports, and system details with precision. You’ve gained a practical understanding of network behavior, enabling you to assess security postures and prepare for vulnerability exploitation in a controlled, ethical manner.
