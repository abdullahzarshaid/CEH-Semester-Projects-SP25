# Ethical_Hacking_Scanning_Networks

## Overview
Module 2 dives into the art of gathering intelligence through Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and footprinting, essential skills for ethical hacking and penetration testing. This module equips you with the ability to uncover valuable information about a target using publicly available resources and tools, setting the foundation for effective reconnaissance.

## Learning Highlights
- **Mastering Reconnaissance with Search Techniques**: By leveraging Google search operators like `intitle:login site:eccouncil.org` and `allinurl:EC-Council career`, you honed the ability to pinpoint specific web assets, such as login pages and career portals, sharpening your skills in targeted information gathering.
- **Automating Intelligence Collection**: Using tools like `theHarvester` across search engines (Bing, Yahoo, Baidu) to extract emails and subdomains taught you how to efficiently scale OSINT efforts, revealing critical insights about organizational structures.
- **Social Media Profiling with Sherlock**: Setting up and running `sherlock satya Nadella` allowed you to explore online presence across platforms, enhancing your ability to build comprehensive profiles of individuals or entities.
- **Web Crawling and Data Extraction**: Commands like `python3 photon.py -u http://www.certifiedhacker.com --wayback` helped you uncover historical website data and hidden assets, boosting your capability to extract actionable intelligence from web resources.
- **Crafting Custom Attack Resources**: Generating a wordlist with `cewl -d 2 -m 5 www.example.com > wordlist.txt` gave you hands-on experience in creating tailored resources for potential security testing scenarios.
- **DNS and Network Reconnaissance**: Tools like `dnsrecon.py` and `nslookup` enabled you to map out DNS records and subdomains, providing a deeper understanding of a target's digital footprint.
- **Network Path Analysis**: Using `tracert` and `traceroute` to trace network routes improved your ability to identify infrastructure details, a key step in planning further penetration testing phases.

## Outcomes
This module has empowered you to systematically gather and analyze publicly available data, a cornerstone of ethical hacking. Youâ€™ve developed a keen eye for detail, learning how to piece together fragmented information into a cohesive reconnaissance report. These skills are crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and preparing for advanced security assessments.
