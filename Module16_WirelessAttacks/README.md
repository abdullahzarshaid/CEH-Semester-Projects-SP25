# Hacking Wireless Devices – Lab Report

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains the lab report for the wireless hacking module conducted by Group 10 as part of the course  Cyber Security Principles at 
The objective of this lab is to explore wireless network reconnaissance, packet analysis, cracking wireless encryption, and simulating
 rogue access point attacks in a controlled and ethical environment. The exercises provide hands-on experience with 
real-world wireless security tools and techniques.
